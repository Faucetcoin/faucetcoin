What is Faucetcoin?
----------------

Faucetcoin is a fork version of Litecoin using scrypt as a proof-of-work algorithm with faster block-time. Faucetcoin is created to change the usual way of distribution of coins, to make it more trader-friendly. Everyone can get a bit, and there's no need to ask someone to give it to you or to buy special devices for mining. All you have to do is just go to the faucet page, enter your Wallet Address and push the button! Almost all coins will be freely distributed through the faucets (1% reserved for bounties and giveaways), however 10% of the coin will be given to miners as a usual block reward. The rest of mining is going to be made for transaction fees.

Transaction fees are 0,030 FAUC

Faucets limit: about 180 000 coins a day total

Development process
-------------------

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think
their feature or bug fix is ready.

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing.
Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if the code doesn't
match the project's coding conventions (see `doc/coding.txt`) or are
controversial.

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. Tags are created regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Faucetcoin.
